summary: Kabam Model

description: |
  Kow (based) Aquatic BioAccumulation Model (KABAM) links hydrophobic organic pesticide bioaccumulation in aquatic components of a food web to terrestrial exposure in birds and mammals. Given the dual ecosystem emphasis, KABAM is divided into two portions: 1) an aquatic bioaccumulation model and 2) a terrestrial risk component. The bioaccumulation model is based off of a widely accepted model by Arnot and Gobas (2004) developed to evaluate PCB and select pesticide transfer through Great Lakes ecosystems. Dietary and respiratory exposures are estimated using a pesticide’s octanol-water partition coefficient (KOW). The terrestrial risk component follows EPA’s TREX model. KABAM spans all trophic levels from aquatic primary producers and consumers to aquatic and terrestrial predators.
