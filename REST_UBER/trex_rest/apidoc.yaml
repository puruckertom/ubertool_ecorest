summary: T-REX Model

description: |
  This spreadsheet-based model calculates the residues on avian and 
  mammalian food items (e.g., short or tall grass, seeds, insects, etc) 
  along with the dissipation rate of a chemical applied to foliar surfaces 
  (for single or multiple applications) in order to estimate acute and 
  reproductive risk quotients. T-REX offers two unique advantages over 
  similar models: 
    1)  the relative body weight of the animal under assessment, as compared 
        to the test animal, is used to adjust acute and chronic toxicity 
        values, and 
    2)  risk quotients are calculated for granular applications and seed 
        treatments. Output for both avian and mammalian diet- and dose-based 
        EEC and RQs are based on upper bound and mean Kenaga values.
